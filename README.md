# ProjectMightySpud

Project MightySpud is going to be a partial game setup that implements the space-to-ground-to-space movement of games like Kerbal Space Program or No Man's Sky.  During the course of the project, we will be implementing these features:

* Generating Terrain from a heightmap image. This will be a pre-existing image (topography of the actual moon), but there is no reason that the texture could not also be procedurally generated. Techniques for this will be discussed.
* Spawning structures and other terrain features on the landscape using an additional structure image map.
* Converting from space coordinates to spherical coordinates to flat-local coordinates and back.
* Transitioning from a space view where a planet is a textured sphere to a land view where the landscape is a terrain object.
* And more!

While this will be a standalone projects for simplicity and clarity, there is nothing stopping you from intergrating features that we developed in Project SpaceCube or even the Procedurally-Generated Galaxy tutorial.
